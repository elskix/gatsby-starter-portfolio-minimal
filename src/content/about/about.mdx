I was always interested in how technologies change the way that we act in the world. Growing up in the 2000's I experienced on my own how our educational environments and cultures are being re-shaped.

Therefore, I love to engage in my studies critically and in-depth with the intersection of technology and education. In my undergraduate studies in digital media and educational studies I found that I like academic work, thus, my current Master studies in IT & Learning were a consequent step for me.

Next to my studies, I gained a lot of work experience during my apprenticeship in a large media house and in my current position as a working student, where I enjoy to learn more about transformation processes, agile project management and what it means to find purpose in your work.
