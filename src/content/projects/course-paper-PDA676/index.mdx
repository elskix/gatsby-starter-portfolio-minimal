**TAKEAWAYS**

**3 takeaways: "Literacies in a Digital World"**
<Underlining color={Theme.colors.secondary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>Concept of Multiliteracies</Underlining>

- Understanding literacy and digital literacy not as a mere extension for reading and writing skills, but as various (digital) practices that can make a person be literate
- This concept helps to not accept a deterministic view on "the" digital skills, but allows to think about it as a more diverse and open framework and ability for learners

<Underlining color={Theme.colors.secondary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>Being aware of Big Words</Underlining>

- Be cautious when big words like *lifelong learning*, *21st century skills* or similar ones are used and trying to look behind the meaning of these
- It will improve my critical reading skills of articles and texts on the topic and make me question more what is the intention

<Underlining color={Theme.colors.secondary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>Critical Data Literacy</Underlining>

- Responsibility as a user to learn about what data is collected, from whom, and how it is used for e.g. marketing purposes
- This is helpful for me as a user to be more considerate about giving away my data and also to highlight the importance of it when talking about datafication

**Course Paper**

The analysis of the EU Skills Agenda for adult learning and the discussion have shown that there is <Underlining color={Theme.colors.secondary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>a need for new literacies in the workplace</Underlining>. The changing technological and social circumstances - on a European level but also in the respective organizations - demand a new level of responsibility and self-management from the individual. To avoid that this increased need for learning and individualization lead do greater disparities, it will be helpful to think about the new and different literacies that people will need to feel safe and empowered.

The brief introduction to the concept of SDL and transformative learning opened up a new interesting field of research for me, around the topic of (informal) professional learning. I think that there is <Underlining color={Theme.colors.secondary} hoverColor={Theme.colors.secondary}>a possible chance for the individual employee as well as for the organization</Underlining>, when SDL becomes a part of a workplace literacy. For the future, I would like to dive deeper into this idea and find out about possible implementations, obstacles, perspectives and the influence of the workplace setting on the ability to pursue SDL.
